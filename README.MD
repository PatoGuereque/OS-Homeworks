# OS Homeworks

This repo contains all the homework patches for the semester. The purpose of having this repo is for the development of the homeworks, I could do revisions of each patch and keep track of them as the form of handing the homeworks in is just handing the patch in.


## Applying patches

To apply the patches is quite simple, just run this:
```
./script.sh apply
```

## Generating the patches

To generate the patches run
```
./script.sh make-patches
```
This will output all the patches in the patches/ folder
